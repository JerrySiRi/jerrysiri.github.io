Hi there! I’m currently an LLM Algorithm Research Intern @Kuaishou Technology, fresh off earning my Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence from Nanjing University under the guidance of Prof. [Cunjing Ge](https://gecunjing.github.io) and Prof. [Yizheng Zhao](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/zhaoyizheng/).

During my undergrad, I was lucky enough to dive into AI research as an research intern Clinical NLP Lab, @Yale University with Prof. [Hua Xu](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/hua-xu/), and Veri-code Team @Shanghai AI Lab, with Prof. [Jie Fu](https://bigaidream.github.io).

I’m passionate about **Open-endness AI**, especially through *Self-Evolving Agents*. I believe it's an essential property of any ASI system. I also keep a close eye on non-autoregressive approaches like *Diffusion LLMs* and *Neuro-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning*.

If you share interests in these directions — I would be genuinely excited to connect, discuss ideas, and explore potential collaborations. (๑¯∀¯๑).
